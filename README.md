# Milestone Project 1 - LSH Electricians


## **Welcome!** 

### This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)/.

### Click here for a link to the live project on GitHub [LSH_Electricians_MS1](https://leah1977.github.io/LSH_Electricians_MS1/)



#### This website provides information on an electrical service for Domestic and Commercial clients.  LSH Electricians are an electrical company serving the Dublin area.  They serve both domestic and commercial clients.  We have been in business for 20 years and would like to launch a new website to promote our company. 

#### We provide a range of services covering all your electrical needs.  From small electrical household jobs to large commercial builds.  We quote for all job sizes.  We specialize in emergency call-outs.  Providing you with the service you need when you need it.

#### This website demonstrates the services we provide and enables you to book a call out or request a quote.



## **UX**

### **Strategy**

#### This website is for owners of properties, residential or commercial who are looking to repair or update their electrics.
#### I want to provide a service that is easy to navigate. 
#### Making it clear and quick to provide information and request a quote or call-out.

### **User Story 1**

#### I found myself constantly searching for a qualified electrician online but was unsure of what to ask for. I wanted to know did they meet all safety standards and was the work guaranteed.

### **User Story 2**

#### I needed an electrician for an emergency call out.  I wanted to find someone fast, efficient and reliable – quickly.  I also needed the someone to call out at a time that was convenient to me.

### **User story 3**

#### We needed a qualified electrician to check our electrics and certify them all for insurance purposes.
#### I want to be able to go onto a website and leave knowing that I will be looked after by a reliable electrician.

### With these user stories in mind, I put together some wireframes.  I included all the main requirements and issues that were raised from my user story research.


### **Scope**


#### Essentials will include

•	Call out
•	Emergency
•	Insurance
•	Guarantee

### Skeleton:

#### I have used Balsamique to draw up 3 page wireframes for Mobile, iPad and Desktop.

#### Click on the following link to view my *wireframes* for this project.

#### I have included wireframes for mobile, ipad and desktop. I plan to build my website from a mobile first approach.  Using mobiles is becoming one of the more favoured ways to search for local services.

#### Click here for a link to the Wireframes [Balsamique LSH_Electricians_MS1](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b7a6a01a-f045-44d7-b5c8-d94d470f1787)

#### I will design the website to adjust to differents sized screens to ensure optimum viewing.
#### I will make sure all links are active and working.

## Features

#### This project will include four separate pages.  A home page, a services page, a contact page and a gallery page.

## Home page

### The home page is made up of a header.  The header includes a logo and two links for quick contact to be made through email or phone.  The header will repeat on all pages.

#### There is a navagational bar with working links to all four pages.  This will appear on all four pages.

#### There is a Covid-19 notice to appear on the home page.  This also shows on the services and contact pages.

#### The home page includes a large image.  The image is responsive to encourage the customer to focus on the overlay text box. The text box displays a call-now button in blue to draw the customers eye again.

#### The footer has three sections.  An about section telling you about the company.  An emergency call out section with phone link.  The last section is to connect the customer to our social links.

## Services Pages

### The services page has a section on the list of sevices we provide
 
** Emergency call out **
** Insurance and Testing **
** Domestic Electrician **
** Commercial Electrician **
** Products **
** Gallery with link to Gallery page. **

#### Followed by a Form with a drop down select menu, to enable the customer to direct their query.


##Contact Pages

#### The contact page includes a map of Dublin provided by Google maps. This displays the service in which LSH Electricians work.

#### Contact and address information for the company.

## Gallery page

#### The gallery page displays some photos and a video of work LSH Electricians provides.

#### This page includes a Testimonial section so customers can read our reviews.

## Additional Features

#### As our website progresses I would like to include a search option and a spares/shop section.


### Surface:

#### I will use the colors 

- Gold
- Grey
- White
- Blue and Green will be used for the buttons so that they will stand out.

#### My Header and footer will use the two main colors

 - Gold
 - Grey
 - White

### Typography

#### I will use the following fonts throughout the website for consistency in style.

 * Roboto
 * Exo
 * Sans Serif as a back up

## Project Display

### This project is responsive to appear on different screen sizes.
### The display changes to accomodate smaller screensize.  On a phone some items have been removed to focus on the mobile friendly application.  For example the form reduces in size, so it can be displayed fully on a smaller device.

### The navigational bar also displays in a two by two format to accomodate the smaller screen size.
