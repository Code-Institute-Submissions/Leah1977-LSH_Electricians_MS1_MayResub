## Introduction


## Welcome!

### This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)/.

### I have created a mobile first project

### Here is a demonstrating of how my website looks on different screensizes using [Am I Responsive Website](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

![Am I responsive](assets/images/responsivedesignms1.png)

## UX

## Skeleton:
---

### I have used Balsamique to draw up 3 page wireframes for Mobile, iPad and Desktop.

### I have included wireframes for mobile, ipad and desktop. I plan to build my website from a mobile first approach.  Using mobiles is becoming one of the more favoured ways to search for local services.

## Project Goals.

### This website provides information on an electrical service for Domestic and Commercial clients.  LSH Electricians are an electrical company serving the Dublin area.  They serve both domestic and commercial clients.  We have been in business for 20 years and would like to launch a new website to promote our company. 

### We provide a range of services covering all your electrical needs.  From small electrical household jobs to large commercial builds.  
### We quote for all job sizes.  
### We specialize in emergency call-outs.  
### Providing you with the service you need when you need it.

### This website demonstrates the services we provide and enables you to book a call out or request a quote.



## Strategy
---

### This website is for owners of properties, residential or commercial who are looking to repair or update their electrics.
### I want to provide a service that is easy to navigate. 
### Making it clear and quick to provide information and request a quote or call-out.
### I will research what may be required for this websit by asking the following questions to a selection of people.

* Would you use a website to look for an electrician?
* What would be your main need for an electrician?
* Would you like a quote?
* What services would you look for?
* Would you like to see previous work completed in a gallery section?
* Would you like to read reviews from customers?


## User Story 1

### As a website user, I found myself constantly searching for a qualified electrician online but was unsure of what to ask for. I wanted to know did they meet all safety standards and was the work guaranteed.

### What I expect to find on a website when looking for an electrician.
 
1. Easy to navigate.
2. Easy to find contact details.
3. Clearly displays the work they carry out.
4. Do they comply with safety standards.

## User Story 2

### As a website user, I needed an electrician for an emergency call out.  I wanted to find someone fast, efficient and reliable â€“ quickly.  I also needed the someone to call out at a time that was convenient to me.

### What I expect to find on a website when looking for an electrician.

1. Do they have an emergency call out option.
2. What times are they available?
3. Are they reliable?
4. What do other customers say about them.

## User story 3

### As a website user, I needed a qualified electrician to check our electrics and certify them all for insurance purposes.
### I expect to be able to go onto a website and leave knowing that I will be looked after by a reliable electrician.

### What I look for on a website when looking for an electrician.

1. Do they work with Safe Electric.
2. Are they registered and certified electricians.
3. Are they reliable?
4. Do they get good reviews?


### With these user stories in mind, I put together some wireframes.  I included all the main requirements and issues that were raised from my user story research.


## Scope

### Essentials will include

*	Call out
*	Emergency
*	Insurance
*	Guarantee
*   A form for request call backs and quotes
*   A gallery page to display work
*   Contact details
 
## Features
---
#### This project will include four separate pages.  

* Home page
* Services page
* Contact page
* Gallery page.

## Home page

### The home page is made up of a header.  The header includes a logo and two links for quick contact to be made through email or phone.  The header will repeat on all pages.

### There is a navagational bar with working links to all four pages.  This will appear on all four pages.

### There is a Covid-19 notice to appear on the home page. 

### The home page includes a large image.  The image is responsive to encourage the customer to focus on the overlay text box. The text box displays a call-now button in blue to draw the customers eye again.

### The footer has three sections.  An about section telling you about the company.  An emergency call out section with phone link.  The last section is to connect the customer to our social links.

## Services Pages

### The services page has a section on the list of sevices we provide
 
* Emergency call out
* Insurance and Testing
* Domestic Electrician
* Commercial Electrician
* Products
* Gallery with link to Gallery page.

### Followed by a Form with a drop down select menu, to enable the customer to direct their query.

## Contact Pages

### The contact page includes a map of Dublin provided by Google maps. This displays the service in which LSH Electricians work.

### Contact and address information for the company.

## Gallery page

### The gallery page displays some photos and a video of work LSH Electricians provides.

### This page includes a Testimonial section so customers can read our reviews.

# Design:
---

## Color Scheme

### I will use the colors in the main body, header and footer

![Color Scheme](assets/images/colorsms1.png)

### My main primary color will be yellow.  I will use variations of this color to add warmth to the pages.  I have used this color when I want something to stand out and catch the viewers attention.

### I have chose variations of white and grey to contrast against the yellow color.  Further enhancing the features.

### I used [Coolers](http://www.coolers.co) to generate my colours for the project. I then used variations within the project.

## Typography

### I will use the following fonts throughout the website for consistency in style.

 * Roboto
 * Exo
 * Sans Serif as a back up

## Additional Features

### As our website progresses I would like to include a search option and a spares/shop section.

## Project Display
---

### This project is responsive to appear on different screen sizes.
### The display changes to accomodate smaller screensize.  On a phone some items have been removed to focus on the mobile friendly application.  For example the form reduces in size, so it can be displayed fully on a smaller device.

### The navigational bar also displays in a two by two format to accomodate the smaller screen size.

### I will design the website to adjust to different sized screens to ensure optimum viewing.
### I will make sure all links are active and working.

## Technologies-used
